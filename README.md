### üîë SITE KEYS

You will change the email in this function to the email you would like responses from the form to be sent to. This is located in the contact.php file. The email currently in place is `szy17604@boofx.com`

    if ($success == false)
    //This user was not verified by recaptcha
    echo "Recaptcha Verification Failed";
    } else if ($success == true) {
    //This user is verified by recaptcha
    if (mail("szy17604@boofx.com", $subject, $Body, $headers)){
    //send successful
    echo "Recaptcha Success, Mail Sent Successfully";
    }else{
    //send failure
    echo "Mailing Failed";
    }
    }

### üîÅ ADDING/REMOVING/CHANGING SUBJECT(S)

There is a section marked where you can edit the subject titles for the emails on the `index.html` file. You can use the following code to add more options and as an outline for how to label them:

`<option value="option-value">DISPLAY OPTION</option>`
